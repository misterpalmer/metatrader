Dynamic version of Xray allows you to control deeper settings for Xray, this includes, lot sizes, trailing stop, stop loss, etc.  
Feel free to use this version if you want more control over the system or want to experiment with the settings.

If you don't want to have to decide, use the main version, and you only need to set risk only, which is more beginner friendly.
